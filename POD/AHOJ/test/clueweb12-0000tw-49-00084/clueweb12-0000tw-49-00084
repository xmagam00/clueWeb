Featured: Granatelli Motorsports Turbo Terror Mustang
7 February 2007 360 views No Comment
The name Granatelli has been associated with speed for more than seventy years. From the Indy 500 to the Bonneville Salt Flats to NHRA Pro Stock racing, the Granatelli family has a way with winning. JR Granatelli, who founded Granatelli Motorsports in 1989, has a particular affection for the Ford Mustang, and is known for having the worldÃ¢ÂÂs fastest modular-powered Mustang, running a 7.17 @ 196 mph that is still a record today. Since its inception, JRÃ¢ÂÂs company has consistently been involved with the Mustang, and when the S197 Mustang was launched in 2005, Granatelli immediately began developing an extensive lineup or performance products for the car.
Wanting to showcase the new parts on a vehicle, JR set out to build the ultimate project car using the majority of parts available from GMS. The result is the Granatelli Motorsports Turbo Terror, a 575 horsepower monster of a Mustang that can tackle any road course or drag strip thrown at it. The driving force behind the car is the Granatelli Turbo Kit that features a 76mm Turbonetics turbo, stainless steel exhaust components, a high flow twin cat system, 2.5Ã¢ÂÂ downpipe, and twin 221 Spearco intercooler cores, and more. The system is tuned by the Granatelli Fuego Flash Tuner, and at 8-10 psi and using pump fuel, the basic kit produces 450 rwhp. On this particular car, the car is running at 12 psi and is making 575 rwhp and 559 lb-ft torque. Along with the extra boost, a Granatelli 3Ã¢ÂÂ Cat-Back Exhaust, 60 lb fuel injectors, and a Granatelli Aluminum Radiator help make the extra power.
Helping to utilize the additional horsepower is a Tremec T-56 6-Speed Transmission from a Shelby GT500 as well as a heavy duty driveshaft. The handling components of the car have also received serious upgrades, mainly featuring the Granatelli 1G Suspension System. The comprehensive handling package includes Tokico D-Spec Adjustable Shocks and a host of GMS components including sway bars, panhard rods, rear lower and upper 3rd link control arms, dual bar strut tower brace, A-arms, sub-frame connectors, billet camber adjusters, and motor mounts. The result is a car capable of 1.00g on a skidpad with smoother, flatter, and more stable handling.
The wheels have been upgraded to lightweight 18-inch Weld Racing Aluma-Stars wrapped in Nitto NT555R Tires, 255/55/18 in the front and 285/45/18 in the rear. The brakes receive Granatelli treatment as well, with slotted and dimpled rotors, GMS braided steel brake lines, and Ford Motorsport brake pads.
With the GMS parts added and the performance upgrades done, Granatelli had the option of leaving the exterior stock to create the ultimate sleeper Mustang. Instead, he added a Cervinis 4-inch Cowl Hood, leaving no doubt as to what is underneath. A Granatelli ProStock-style wing, and a Street Scene Equipment Body Kit also hint at the power produced by this Mustang. Finally, a two-tone paint scheme is added – speed yellow over jet black, with a thin red pinstripe to separate the two. The interior is somewhat more conservative, with only the addition of GMS gauge faces, Auto Meter auxiliary gauges, and a carbon fiber shift knob.
Being the GMS project car, this Mustang is in a perpetual state of change. New parts from Granatelli are always being added or switched. So whatÃ¢ÂÂs in store for this turbo monster? More boost, if you can believe it. A Currie Enterprises 9-inch crate rear end is also in the works.

Competition – Win Discounted Tickets to The Next Web Conference in Amsterdam

Our friends over at The Next Web have kindly given us five discounted tickets to their conference in Amsterdam to give away to you lovely people! This is the 7th conference from The Next Web and it’s definitely established itself as one not to miss.
This year’s speakers so far include Kevin Rose (founder of Digg, angel investor, entrepeneur), Chad Hurley (founder of Youtube, CEO of Delicious), Alexis Ohanian (co-founder of Reddit) and Susan Crawford (professor in New York). There’s also lots of other cool events at the conference, including a startup rally and hack battle. And of course, you get an excuse to visit one of the most amazing cities on the planet.
Full price tickets are selling at Ã¢ÂÂ¬999 but we’re giving you the chance to purchase a ticket for Ã¢ÂÂ¬590 (excluding tax). We only have five available at this price so we’re going to make you work, just a little bit. And what better chance than to roll out a picture of our office cat. For your chance to win, just leave a comment with your best caption for the picture below. You have until 12pm (GMT) on 13th March to enter, with winners announced later that day. Good luck!

Win a ‘discounted’ ticket… Sounds more like a sale than a competition

Hey Joe. I take your point but we only have 5 to give away at this price so competition seemed like the right way to go! Or was that your caption?

To be fair it is a reasonable discount + discount early bird. Inc vat – 773,50. Business 650 I guess without vat. So 590 + 19% tax = 702.ÃÂ  A saving for sure
